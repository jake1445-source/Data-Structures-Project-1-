# Campus Event Scheduler

## Overview
The **Campus Event Scheduler** is a Python-based application that helps manage, sort, and detect conflicts among scheduled campus events. It supports both **array-based** and **linked list-based** data structures for storing event data, allowing comparisons of performance and efficiency. Additionally, a **parallelized conflict detection** module enhances performance for large datasets.

## Features

- 📅 **Event Management** – Create, view, and organize campus events.
- 🔗 **Linked List & Array Support** – Compare event operations using different data structures.
- 🧩 **Sorting Algorithms** – Implements multiple sorting methods to order events by date/time.
- ⚔️ **Conflict Detection** – Identify overlapping or conflicting events.
- 🚀 **Parallelized Conflict Search** – Uses Python’s multiprocessing to speed up conflict detection.
- 🧪 **Testing Suite** – Unit tests to validate sorting and searching functionalities.

## Core Concepts

| Module | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **EventsList.py** | Contains the `Event` class and helper functions for creating and managing events. |
| **LinkedList.py** | Implements a custom singly linked list structure. |
| **Sorting.py** | Houses different sorting algorithms and benchmarking utilities. |
| **Search_and_Conflict.py** | Detects overlapping events sequentially and in parallel. |

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Campus-Event-Scheduler.git
   cd Campus-Event-Scheduler
   ```

2. Run the main script or notebooks:
   ```bash
   python src/EventsList.py
   ```

   Or explore results in Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Report_Notebook.ipynb
   ```

## Running Tests
To execute all tests:
```bash
python -m unittest discover testing
```

---

## Future Improvements
- Add a GUI or web dashboard using Flask/Streamlit.
- Integrate with a real database (e.g., SQLite/PostgreSQL).
- Implement user authentication for personalized scheduling.

## Contributors
**Atharva Zodpe**: Developed searching algorithms and the conflict detection program.

**Griffin Keener**: Compiled and organized code into Github and Final notebook. I modified the code from all of the packages to be user-friendly. Worked on visualizations, and developed the array-based data structure.

**Sam Goodell**: Built linked list, linked list methods, and linked list sorting algorithms.

**Sofie Appell**: Created the array sorting algorithms and completed the runtime trials. I also determined and calculated the memory usage for the scalability challenge.
